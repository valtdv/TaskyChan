Tasky-chan comes with a lot of different features that can help you be more organized in your daily life!
* **Tasks** - Tasky allows you to create tasks, which have a deadline, and can have a description and subtasks if you want to.
* **Activities** - Unlike tasks, activities do not have a deadline but instead are repeated every week at a certain hour. They do not have subactivities but can have a description if you desire.
* **Reminders** - Besides the notifications that tasks and activities have by default, Tasky allows you to set up new reminders at any hour so you can remember all the important stuff in your life!
* **Streaks** - If you ever want to stop or start a habit, Tasky can help you with that! Tasky can track how many days you've gone doing/not doing any habit that you want to have/might have and rewards you for every week you've gone without breaking your streak.
* **Advices** - Sometimes we don't know what to do with our life, and because of that Tasky has several tips and advices that can help you solve your problems, or at least make you smile.
